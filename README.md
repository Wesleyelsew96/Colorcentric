# Colorcentric

A tile-based puzzle game

The goal is to get the colored tiles into the center, hence the name, "Colorcentric".

I created the game in July and August, 2017, with the (at the time) sole purpose of learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS (the languages I wrote it in). My goal with the game now, in general, is to get noticed/recognized by a potential hirer, and hopefully get an entry level job in a programming job. I don't ever plan on trying to make money with the game, and anyone who wants to use my source code is more than welcome to. Who knows, maybe this game will go viral someday.

Thanks for playing!
